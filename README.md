# MEG-CHECK_RELEASE

📊 Check Release Data Pipeline & Financial Analysis Dashboard - Megaworld

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering and analytics workflow, transforming raw financial data into actionable business insights.

I built a complete pipeline that:

📂 Extracts raw CSV data

🧹 Cleans and transforms data using Python

🗄 Loads structured data into PostgreSQL (Docker Image)

📊 Develops interactive dashboards in Power BI

📄 Delivers executive-ready insights via exported PDF reports

This project highlights my skills in ETL development, database management, and business intelligence reporting.

🐍 Python (🐼 pandas, 💻 psycopg2)

🦣 PostgreSQL

☀️ Power BI

📓 Jupyter Notebook

💻 SQL

Data Cleaning & Transformation

🔄 ETL Implementation
1️⃣ Extract

Ingested multiple CSV datasets

Consolidated and prepared for transformation

2️⃣ Transform

Standardized column names

Converted date fields to proper datetime format

Cleaned inconsistent numeric formats

Handled null and missing values

Validated financial totals

3️⃣ Load

Designed structured tables in PostgreSQL

Implemented database connection using psycopg2

Loaded cleaned datasets for reporting and analytics

📊 Business Intelligence & Reporting (Power BI)

Using PostgreSQL as the data source, I developed interactive dashboards to analyze financial check releases.

🔎 Key Insights (January–February 2026)

💰 ₱2.89 Billion total amount released

🧾 3,229 checks released

👥 530 unique payees

📈 ₱894.90K average release amount

🏢 Highest releasing project: Arcovia Park Place

🧮 ₱244M released under unidentified billing numbers

⚠️ Significant unclaimed checks from July 2025

The final dashboard was exported into a presentation-ready PDF for stakeholder reporting.

💡 What This Project Demonstrates

✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing at scale
✅ Building structured ETL workflows (used docker and python to connect both network and automate ETL workflow)
✅ Database integration and optimization
✅ Financial data analysis
✅ Creating executive-level dashboards
✅ Translating raw data into decision-ready insights

📌 Why This Matters

This project reflects real-world financial reporting scenarios where:

Data arrives messy and fragmented

Accuracy is critical

Stakeholders require clear, visual insights

Reports must be presentation-ready

It demonstrates my ability to bridge data engineering and business intelligence effectively.
